    "\n",
    "A moment is a quantitative measure that says something about the shape of a distribution. There are central moments and non-central moments. This section is focused on the central moments.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 0th central moment is the total probability and is always equal to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 1st moment is the mean (expected value).\n",
    "\n",
    "The 2nd central moment is the variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Variance** = The average of the squared distance of the mean. Variance is interesting in a mathematical sense, but the standard deviation is often a much better measure of how spread out the distribution is.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Standard Deviation** = The square root of the variance\n",
    "\n",
    "![](http://www.visualmining.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/analytics_formula_std_dev.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The 3rd central moment is the skewness.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Skewness** = A measure that describes the contrast of one tail versus the other tail. For example, if there are more high values in your distribution than low values then your distribution is 'skewed' towards the high values.\n",

    "![](http://www.visualmining.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/analytics_formula_skewness.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The 4th central moment is the kurtosis.\n",

    "**Kurtosis** = A measure of how 'fat' the tails in the distribution are.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](http://www.visualmining.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/analytics_formula_kurtosis.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The higher the moment, the harder it is to estimate with samples. Larger samples are required in order to obtain good estimates."
