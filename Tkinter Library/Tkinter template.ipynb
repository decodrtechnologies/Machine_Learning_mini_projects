    "### What is Event Driven Programming?\n",
    "\n",
    "Event-driven programming is a programming paradigm in which the flow of program execution is determined by events - for example a user action such as a mouse click, key press, or a message from the operating system or another program. \n",
    "\n",
    "- An event-driven application is designed to detect events as they occur, and then deal with them using an appropriate event-handling procedure. \n",
    "- In a typical modern event-driven program, there is no discernible flow of control. The main routine is an event-loop that waits for an event to occur, and then invokes the appropriate event-handling routine.\n",
    "- Event callback is a function that is invoked when something significant happens like when click event is performed by user or the result of database query is available.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction to GUI:\n",
    "- A graphical user interface allows the user to interact with the operating system and other programs using graphical elements such as icons, buttons, and dialog boxes.\n",
    "- GUIs popularized the use of the mouse.\n",
    "- GUIs allow the user to point at graphical elements and click the mouse button to activate them.\n",
    "- GUI Programs Are Event-Driven\n",
    "- User determines the order in which things happen\n",
    "- GUI programs respond to the actions of the user, thus they are event driven.\n",
    "- The tkinter module is a wrapper around tk, which is a wrapper around tcl, which is what is used to create windows and graphical user interfaces.\n",
